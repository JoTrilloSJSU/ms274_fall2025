Mixing in SLO Bay

In this modeling project I plan to investigate the effect of altering mixing in San Luis Obispo Bay. This will be done either by changing the mixing parameters for a single mixing package, or alternatively by comparing the results of different mixing packages. However, the overall question remains the same:

Given the same intitial conditions what effect does changing model mixing parameters have on SLO Bay Dynamics?

Project Description

To investigate this question, I will construct a model spanning the length of SLO Bay and run it for the month of June 2025. This will allow for comparison with observational data collected during the same time period. I will run my model once without including any mixing package and compare it with 2-3 models runs with different mixing parameters. This data will then be compared to observational data.

For initial conditions, I will use the state of the model used in a submesoscale dynamics proect (SubFex) in June of 2025. This model has a reolution of 125m which is important to be able to model submescale effects. I will then create visuals to compare differences and anomalies between runs.
